# Reinforcement Learning

1. IDQN: the Independent_DQN.ipynb file train and generate a model that can then be used with the deploy_IDON_model.ipynb code to deploy on the drones.

2. PPO: The PPO folder contains the trained PPO model (ppo_frequency_model.pth) and scripts for training and deployment. The model is trained using train_ppo.py on RL logs (train_rl_logs.csv) and deployed using deploy_ppo_script.py for real-time adaptive frequency selection in the cloud environment.
